You will be trying to reproduce this web page as closely as possible by only modifying the contents of `css/about.css`.

To get started, open `about.html` in your web browser, and open `css/about.css` in a text editor of your choice. You have 30 minutes to get as close to the reference as possible. Feel free to use online references, but avoid using GenAI to write your code for you since a fundamental understanding of CSS is necessary in this role.
